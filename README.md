# measure_numbers
### What's this?
This program is a Rust exercise written on The Rust Programming Language Chapter 8.
> Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the mean (the average value), 
> median (when sorted, the value in the middle position), 
> and mode (the value that occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.
